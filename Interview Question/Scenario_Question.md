Scenario 1:

"Imagine you have 50 Linux servers. You are asked to install Apache on all of them. How would you do it using Ansible?"

Ideal Answer:
"I would create a Playbook to automate the Apache installation.
First, I would list all 50 servers in the Inventory file.
Then, in the Playbook, I would define a task using the yum module (for RedHat/CentOS) or apt module (for Ubuntu) to install Apache.
Example:

- name: Install Apache Web Server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

Finally, I would run the Playbook using ansible-playbook install_apache.yml.
This way, installation happens in parallel across all servers without logging into each one manually."


Scenario 2:

"You have to update a configuration file on 100 servers without affecting running services. How would you use Ansible for this?"

Ideal Answer:
"I would use Ansibleâ€™s copy or template module to update the configuration file.
Before making changes, I'd backup the original file.
Also, I would add a task to update the file and a handler to restart the service only if the file changes.
Example:

- name: Update configuration file
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Backup old config
      copy:
        src: /etc/myapp/config.conf
        dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf.bak
        remote_src: yes

    - name: Update config file
      copy:
        src: new_config.conf
        dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
      notify: Restart myapp

  handlers:
    - name: Restart myapp
      service:
        name: myapp
        state: restarted

This way, services are only restarted if the configuration file is modified, reducing unnecessary downtime."


Scenario 3:

"How would you set up password-less SSH access to your target machines before running Ansible Playbooks?"

Ideal Answer:
"Ansible relies on SSH to connect to the target machines.
To enable password-less SSH:

    I would generate an SSH key pair on my control machine using ssh-keygen.

    Then, I would copy the public key to all target machines using ssh-copy-id user@hostname.

    After that, Ansible can connect without asking for passwords every time.
    This setup makes automation faster, especially when managing a large number of servers."

Would you also like me to give you a bonus Ansible mini-project idea (like one you can mention in interviews if they ask about hands-on experience)? ðŸš€
It can really impress interviewers! Want me to send one? ðŸŽ¯
Is this conversation helpful so far?
